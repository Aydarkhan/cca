### Cyclic cellular automata (CCA) editor

**Cellular automaton** is a set of cells. Each cell can be in one of several possible states. Cell can change its state, according to state of neighbors of the cell. This process is determined by transition rules. **Cyclic cellular automaton** is a kind of cellular automaton, its set of states is a cycle, and cell changes its state to next one, according to cycle order. It works with **2-dimentional cyclic cellular automaton** with rectangular field. Transition rules should be defined through number of neighbors of the cell in same state. This program allows user to change number of cell`s states, order of states and transition rules for each state.
